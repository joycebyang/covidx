The objective of this project is to build a binary classifier for chest radiography images in order to separate normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients from one another. The importance of these distinct classes is due to the fact that patients often are misdiagnosed as COVID-19 when in reality the patient has a different respiratory disease, vice versa.
